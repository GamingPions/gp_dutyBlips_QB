You know what’s annoying? You come to your favourite roleplay server, you want to go to the mechanic or to your favourite restaurant, but you don’t know if anyone is there?

Sure, you could take out your mobile phone and look up the corresponding number and call it. But who wants to make a phone call?

With this practical script, you can simply colour in the mechanic’s blips based on the OnDuty employees. No one there? The blip is red. If an employee now goes on duty, it becomes green, for example. And if the boss is there, a green tick even appears on the blip!

Features
What colour the blip should have for how many employees.
A green tick if the boss is there (you can also deactivate this).
As many blips for as many jobs as you need
